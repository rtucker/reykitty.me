Welcome to my all-new web site!

I was inspired to create this site by a bunch of local [furries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom). It's been a long while since I've made a web site at all (2018, according to [gender.solutions](https://gender.solutions/)), much less one about me (2008??).

Be sure to check out the [about page](@/about.md) and the [now page](@/now.md).

This web site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Currently, it's manually built on my laptop and `rsync`'d to my web provider whenever I decide it's time to upload it. The site theme is [Emily](https://github.com/kyoheiu/emily_zola_theme), with a few modifications.

There is currently no public-facing `git` repository for this site. I'm going to rectify this soon.

Can I insert cat photos here?

Yes, yes I can! Excellent.
