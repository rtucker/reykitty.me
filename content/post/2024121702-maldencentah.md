I was recently informed that Malden Cent**er** and Malden Cent**re** both exist. They're about 0.6 km / 0.4 mi from each other.

[Malden Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malden_Center_station) is an intermodal transit station, providing bus, subway, and commuter rail connections. Malden Centre, on the other hand, is a hamlet-like thing (a populated place?) about 120 m / 400 ft from the center of Malden.

Worth noting: Malden Center is on Centre Street, while Malden Centre is not.
