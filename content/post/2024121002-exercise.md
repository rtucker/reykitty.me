So, about a week ago, I began a bit of a daily exercise program at the encouragement of some random online person. It's pretty simple at this point, and it's all stuff I can do in my room.

Why? Because I've gotten a little flabby, and want to reinvigorate my core muscles and endurance. Also I find that movement helps my mood a fair bit, so I want to keep this up for mental health reasons.

Anyway, here's what my morning exercise program entails currently:

* [Crunches](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Crunches): 3 sets of 10
* [Mountain Climbers](https://www.verywellfit.com/mountain-climbers-exercise-3966947): 1 set of 20
* Go for a walk at least every third day, weather-permitting

That's it.

Will this yield results? Probably! At the very least, it feels pretty good.
