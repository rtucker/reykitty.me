*Post soundtrack: [Yaeji - Waking Up Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNNf4I1dc_U)*

I've been working on my sleep lately. I'd been sleeping "too much" and waking up groggy and unrefreshed, so there's a fair bit to work on.

First thing I did was a review of my medications. I identified a likely culprit, [mirtazapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine), and set about ramping down on it over the span of a few months, with the assistance of my psychiatrist. I've now been completely off of it for a month.

I also adjusted my bedtime dose of [gabapentin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin) from 600 mg to 300 mg, to also help reduce the sleepiness and drowsiness side effects.

Anyway, I've got great news everyone! I'm now generally waking up an hour before my alarm ðŸ˜©. I'm feeling better but still not feeling great in the mornings, but I'm awake and that's good, I suppose.
