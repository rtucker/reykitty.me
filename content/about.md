Greetings! Welcome to my page on the World Wide Web. Here's a little bit about me:

* My name is **Rey** (they/she)
* I'm **transgender**, **non-binary**, **aromantic**, and **grey-asexual**
* I have wicked **ADHD** and **anxiety**
* I'm **polyamorous**
* I'm in my **mid-40s**
* I live in the **Boston, Massachusetts** area, with two amazing people and a cat named **Nigel**
* I'm an **electrical engineer** who knows how to program and do IT stuff, but I've been unable to work for a few years

This is the first time I've built a *personal* web site in quite some time. I've been on social media a lot, perhaps too much... I've burned out on the Twitter-style feeds of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and am looking to chill a bit with the slower web.
