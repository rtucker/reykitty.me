Hi there! I'm not great at writing introductions. Nonetheless, here's a little bit about me.

* My name is **Rey** (they/she)
* I'm **transgender**, **non-binary**, **aromantic**, and [**grey-asexual**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_asexuality)
* I've got the AAAA: **autism**, **ADHD**, **anxiety**, and **agoraphobia**
* I'm **polyamorous**
* I'm in my **mid-40s**
* I live in the **Boston, Massachusetts** area, with two amazing folks and a cat named [**Nigel**](/tags/nigel)
* I'm an **electrical engineer** who knows how to program and do IT stuff, but I've been unable to work for a few years

This is the first time I've built a *personal* web site in quite some time. I've been on social media a lot, perhaps too much... I've burned out on the Twitter-style feeds of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and am looking to chill a bit with the slower web.

I was born and raised in Iowa, but moved out when I turned 18 and then spent a couple of decades in Rochester, New York. My Rochester tenure ended in mid-2020 when I moved in with my partner near Boston.

I don't own a car, as of 2021. I don't have access to a car, unless I ask a friend. I don't drive. I don't really even like riding in cars any more. Boston traffic will do that to you. I get around by foot, by bus, and by subway train.

Disability is a part of my life. I've been struggling to recover from a combination of illness and burnout that wiped me out sometime in 2018-2019. I can't think as well as I used to, my memory doesn't always work, and I now walk with a cane. I don't really know exactly what happened. This whole thing left me anxious and depressed and traumatized, which is a hole I'm working on getting out of.
