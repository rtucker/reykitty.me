### And more about me

This is the first time I've built a *personal* web site in quite some time. I've been on social media a lot, perhaps too much... I've burned out on the Twitter-style feeds of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and am looking to chill a bit with the slower web.

I was born and raised in Iowa, but moved out when I turned 18. I spent a couple of decades in Rochester, New York. My Rochester tenure ended in 2020 when I moved to the Boston area. I currently live with my partner and a housemate, as well as a cat named [Nigel](/tags/nigel).

I don't own a car, as of 2021. I don't have access to a car, unless I ask a friend for a ride. I no longer drive. I don't really even like riding in cars any more. Boston traffic will do that to you. I get around by foot, by bus, and by subway train, or sometimes by taxi or rideshare.

Disability is now a part of my life. I've been struggling to recover from a combination of illness and burnout that wiped me out sometime in 2018-2019. I can't think as well as I used to, my memory doesn't always work, and I now walk with a cane. I don't really know exactly what happened. This whole thing left me anxious and depressed and traumatized, which is a hole I'm working on getting out of.

I struggle with agoraphobia, which is an anxiety disorder where I feel extremely unsafe and anxious in unfamiliar or uncontrolled environments. From a practical standpoint, it makes leaving the house quite difficult, especially alone. I can usually go for a walk around the block every few days, or on expeditions to a few familiar places every few weeks/months, but only on specific routes during mid-day hours.
