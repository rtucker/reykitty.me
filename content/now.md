**This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)**, containing information about what I'm doing right now!

**I'm going to a solstice party this weekend**, which is exciting and a little bit scary. It's out in the *Middle of Nowhere* so we'll be there overnight. Fortunately, I will have this very nifty page to use as a reference when asked what I've been up to lately. Don't worry, though! Nigel will be auto-fed by the auto-feeder.

**I'm working on this web site**. I've been inspired by hanging out with a small group of local furries in the basement of the library, working on web site stuff. It was really good to see folks working on their own web sites. I worked on [gender.solutions](https://gender.solutions/), my 2018-era shitpost. It hadn't been rebuilt in more than six years. That was fun.

**I've been playing with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)**, an ad-hoc mesh network for position reporting, telemetry, messaging, etc. It's kind of like [APRS](https://www.aprs.org/), but it's based on [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) and uses unlicensed radio spectrum. Right now I just have a single node sitting in the window, but I can definitely see how some of my friends end up with a plurality of nodes.

**I'm working on seeing my friends** and misc other people again. Agoraphobia and anxiety and other mental and physical health issues have left me fairly isolated over the past few years, and I've really been feeling it lately. So, local friends, come on through! Let's eat burritos and cuddle.
