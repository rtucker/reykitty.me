**This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)**, containing information about what I'm doing right now!

**Happy Holidays**! Today is Christmas, which tends to be a somewhat meh day for me these days. But, making the best of it. Merry Christmas and Happy First Night of Hanukkah!

**I've been playing with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)**, an ad-hoc mesh network for position reporting, telemetry, messaging, etc. It's kind of like [APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) conceptually, but it's based on [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) and uses unlicensed radio spectrum. Right now I just have a single node sitting in the window, but I can definitely see how some of my friends end up with a plurality of nodes.

**I'm working on seeing my friends** and misc other people again. Agoraphobia and anxiety and other mental and physical health issues have left me fairly isolated over the past few years, and I've really been feeling it lately. So, local friends, come on through! Let's eat burritos and cuddle.

**I am trying to reduce the amount of cannabis I consume**. It's been a bit of a problem for awhile now, and I've been unable to meaningfully reduce on my own. So, I now have an addiction specialist helping me with this. The hard part is figuring out what to do *instead* of weed.
