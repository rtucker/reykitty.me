**This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)**, containing information about what I'm doing right now!

---

**I'm working on this web site right now.** I've been inspired by hanging out with a small group of local furries in the basement of the library, working on web site stuff. It was really good to see folks working on their own web sites. I worked on [gender.solutions](https://gender.solutions/), my 2018-era shitpost. It hadn't been rebuilt in more than six years. That was fun.

**I've been playing with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)**, an ad-hoc mesh network for position reporting, telemetry, messaging, etc. It's kind of like [APRS](https://www.aprs.org/), but it's based on [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) and uses unlicensed radio spectrum. Right now I just have a single node sitting in the window, but I can definitely see how some of my friends end up with a plurality of nodes.

**My birthday is coming up quite soon**, so I'm starting to think about what I'd like to do. I think it's too late to plan a big birthday bash kind of thing, but maybe a cake would be nice. I haven't had a legitimate birthday gathering since the Before Times, though, and I yearn for one.

**I'm also working on seeing my friends** and misc other people again. Agoraphobia and anxiety and other mental and physical health issues have left me fairly isolated over the past few years, and I've really been feeling it lately. So, local friends, come on through! Let's eat burritos and cuddle.
