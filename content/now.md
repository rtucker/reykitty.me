**This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)**, containing information about what I'm doing right now!

**Surgery!** Last Friday, I had a gender-affirming [orchiectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchiectomy). As I'm writing this (Monday afternoon), I'm doing pretty okay. I'm on various medical restrictions until at least March 10th, when I have a followup appointment. Ibuprofen, ice packs, and rest are handling things nicely.

**I'm working on seeing my friends** and misc other people again. Agoraphobia and anxiety and other mental and physical health issues have left me fairly isolated over the past few years, and I've really been feeling it lately. So, local friends, come on through! Let's eat burritos and cuddle.

**I am working to reduce the amount of cannabis I consume**. It's been a bit of a problem for awhile now, and I've been unable to meaningfully reduce on my own. So, I now have an addiction specialist helping me with this. The hard part is figuring out what to do *instead* of weed. (UPDATE: Made it 111 hours without cannabis, between January 17-21. The insomnia sucks.) (UPDATE 2: I'm at 4 weeks without cannabis as of February 24! I was expecting to have to break the break to manage orchi pain, but nope.)

**Mostly QRT on ham radio right now**. The equipment is still set up and ready to go at any time, I just haven't been in the mood for it. I'm still available for HF FT8 skeds with cool people though. I think my next ham radio project is going to involve slow-scan television.
