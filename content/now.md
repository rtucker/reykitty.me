**This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)**, containing information about what I'm doing right now!

**Greetings from HTML Day 2025 Boston!** It's been about 6 months since I've updated this web site, so I figure now is a good time. It's a gorgeous day here, 23 degrees C and sunny with a pleasant breeze. There's probably at least 20 of us nerds here? Good times.

**My eBike era** has begun! Earlier this year, a couple of friends loaned me one of their extra eBikes, a purple 2016-ish Townie. I love her. I can haul groceries and stuff, go places, and generally enjoy the bike network that Somerville is building. Being able to move around at ~15 mph instead of having to walk everywhere is great. She's beautiful and has a personality and *moods* and about ~50 km range on a single charge.

**I broke my right thumb back in early June.** Long story short, I mis-managed a turn on the Somerville Community Path (yeah, the School Street crossing) and crashed into a chain link fence. I thought I was fine, but, well, my thumb started hurting and it didn't stop hurting and the x-ray showed a distal phalanx fracture. Six weeks in a splint. Showering without getting your dominant hand wet is challenging, but I succeeded.

**Hello again, Vyvanse!** After shifting around a bunch of medications and getting my mental health under better control, I've been started on Vyvanse again (for the first time since 2019). We're still honing in the dose I need (the FOCUS/ANXIETY knob) but already it's nice to be able to... uh... do things. With my brain. Again.

**Resocializing continues** this summer. I've making it out of the house most of the nice days, and seeing friends at least once a week. This has been a major improvement to my mental and physical health. Also got a lot more `REDACTED` goin' on too. I've also been attending *events* such as [Nuzzle](https://nuzzle.boston/) and [Lovebite](https://lovebite.party/), which is helping a lot with meeting new people and overcoming agoraphobia.

**Cannabis overuse is improving** such that I'm pretty much only using it before bedtime or if I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm happy with this, and also going months between trips to the weed store.

**Ham radio activity** has been sporadic, but is still happening occasionally. Mostly transmitting trans pride flags on 14.230 MHz SSTV in response to fashy stuff. Still available for FT8 and other misc skeds. (Anyone wanna do some Feld Hell?)
